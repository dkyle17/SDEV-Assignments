// Design a retirement planning calculator for Skulling Financial Services.
// Allow a user to enter a value that represents the number of working years remaining in the user’s career and another value for the annual amount of money the user can save.
// Assume that the user earns 3 percent simple interest on savings annually. Program output is a schedule that lists each year number in retirement starting with year 0 and the user’s savings at the start of that year.
// Assume that the user spends $60,000 per year in retirement and then earns 3 percent interest on the remaining balance. End the list after 30 years or when the user’s balance is 0 or less, whichever comes first
